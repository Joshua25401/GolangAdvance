	Motivation of Composite Design Pattern :
		-> Object use other objects fields/method through embedding
		-> Composition let us make compound object :
			- A Shape of Group made from several different shape
			- A Mathematical expression composed from simple mathematical expression, etc
		-> Composite Design Pattern is used to treat single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly
		-> Example :
			- Foo object (Foo) and Array of Foo Object ([]Foo) have a common API

	Composite Design Pattern :
		-> A Mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and composition objects in uniform manner
